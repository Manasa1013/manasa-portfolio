                <h1>Autonomous cars(dummy blog)</h1>
            <small>December, 2020</small>
            <p>In recent years, research and experiments are being conducted in making autonomous vehicle control possible.Many demonstrations were done on this self driving cars using radio-control, many sensors such as radars and actuators. For full fledged autonomous and self driving control, there is a need to train the vehicle in such a way that it is completely autonomous without any human intervention.For self governing or autonomous feature, the control algorithms are used.
                Before implementing in real-time systems, we implement the algorithms in simulation environments like Matlab.Here we use ‘fuzzy logic’ in Matlab simulation environment to develop our control algorithms for mainly obstacle avoidance. Matlab has many tool boxes which help us to test all the rules that are involved in driving the car. From driving scenario generation, we collect data and augment,access the required data from it and then we create membership functions and rules in the fuzzy logic designer  with the fuzzy values.
                The crisp values are taken from the driving scenario generation toolbox to obtain the accurate autonomous driving.
                After testing all the rules with the values the sensors are integrated .

                <p>Fuzzification is the process of assigning the numerical input of a system to fuzzy sets with some degree of membership. This degree of membership may be anywhere within the interval [0,1]. If it is 0 then the value does not belong to the given fuzzy set, and if it is 1 then the value completely belongs within the fuzzy set. Any value between 0 and 1 represents the degree of uncertainty that the value belongs in the set. These fuzzy sets are typically described by words, and so by assigning the system input to fuzzy sets, we can reason with it in a linguistically natural manner.
                    For example, in the image below the meanings of the expressions cold, warm, and hot are represented by functions mapping a temperature scale. A point on that scale has three "truth values"—one for each of the three functions. The vertical line in the image represents a particular temperature that the three arrows (truth values) gauge. Since the red arrow points to zero, this temperature may be interpreted as "not hot"; i.e. this temperature has zero membership in the fuzzy set "hot". The orange arrow (pointing at 0.2) may describe it as "slightly warm" and the blue arrow (pointing at 0.8) "fairly cold". Therefore, this temperature has 0.2 membership in the fuzzy set "warm" and 0.8 membership in the fuzzy set "cold". The degree of membership assigned for each fuzzy set is the result of fuzzification.
